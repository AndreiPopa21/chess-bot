## Description

This chess bot was developed as part of a faculty assignment and was awarded the first place in an internal championship. 
The program implements succesfully the [Chess Engine Communication Protocol](https://www.gnu.org/software/xboard/engine-intf.html) and can be played and tested using [XBoard Chess Interface](https://www.gnu.org/software/xboard/). Main code consists of several Java source files as well as of a Makefile that can be used for automation.
